RPIO is an advanced GPIO module for the Raspberry Pi.

* PWM via DMA (up to 1us resolution)
* GPIO input and output (drop-in replacement for `RPi.GPIO <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO>`_)
* GPIO interrupts (callbacks when events occur on input gpios)
* TCP socket interrupts (callbacks when tcp socket clients send data)
* Command-line tools ``rpio`` and ``rpio-curses``
* Well documented, fast source code with minimal CPU usage
* Open source (LGPLv3+)


`Visit pythonhosted.org/RPIO for the documentation. <http://pythonhosted.org/RPIO>`_


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install/update RPIO on a Raspberry Pi is with either ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install -U RPIO

After the installation you can use ``import RPIO`` as well as the command-line tools ``rpio`` and ``rpio-curses``.

Debian packages are available at `metachris.github.com/rpio/download <http://metachris.github.com/rpio/download/latest/>`_.

An Arch Linux PKGBUILD is available at `aur.archlinux.org/packages/rpio <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rpio/>`_.


Examples
--------

You can find lots of examples inside the `documentation <http://pythonhosted.org/RPIO>`_, as well as in the `/examples/ source directory <https://github.com/metachris/RPIO/tree/master/examples>`_.
